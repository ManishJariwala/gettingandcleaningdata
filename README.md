Getting and Cleaning Data Course at John Hopkins
======================

Overall Summary
  Programming assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data is to create R code that would do following: download file from provided URL, tidy data, and calculate mean for "mean and standard deviation" dimension by activity and subject.  Final summarize result wil be in the file.  The attached code run_Analysis.R does exactly that and downloads the final result in MJ_tidy_data.txt.

Raw Data Information
  The source data is broken into two groups (test and train) and three major categories -observation, activity and subject. 30 subjects were divided into test (30%) and train (70%) group.  Each subject performed six activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).  Following files are provided:
  
•	X_train.txt -  Observation for subjects that were grouped in train. It has list of 561 observation across all six activity.
	
•	X_test.txt - Observations for subjects that were grouped in train. It has list of 561 observation across all six activity.
	
•	featuers.txt -  names of columns of all the observations in x_train and x_test
	
•	y_train.txt -  contains activity associated with x_train
